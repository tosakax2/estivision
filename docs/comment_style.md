# Comment Style Guide

This project uses banner comments for readability. Use the following formats:

- **Section headers and footers**:

```python
# ==== Section Title ====
# ====                     # footer line (optional)
```

- **Sub-comments**:

```python
# ---- Sub comment ----
```

Keep comment text brief and capitalize as needed. End every file with a newline.
